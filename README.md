# Data Wrangling
Data wrangling involves gathering, assessing and cleaning data in preparation for exploration and reporting.
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

Wrangling efforts will be documented in a Jupyter Notebook and showcased through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
More details about the whole process can be found in the `wrangle_report.pdf`
